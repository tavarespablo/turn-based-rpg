1. Implement action bar logic for both player and goblin (fills over time, triggers turn). ✅

2. Add goblin AI: goblin attacks automatically when its action bar is full.

3. Enable player actions: attack, defend, use item, run (menu selection and effects).

4. Handle health and damage: update HP for player and goblin, show defeat/victory.

5. Animate actions: show attack/defend/item effects visually.

6. Reset action bars after each turn/action.
Add win/lose conditions and end battle screen.
